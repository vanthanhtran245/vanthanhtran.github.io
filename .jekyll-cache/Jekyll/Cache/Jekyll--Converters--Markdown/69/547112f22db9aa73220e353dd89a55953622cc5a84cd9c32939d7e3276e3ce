I"Ð<p>Iâ€™m trying to prepare a single dynamic framework for third party. My framework (A.framework) uses third-party recognition static framework (B.framework). I canâ€™t provide separate A and B frameworks to the customer. Ideally B.framework should be built and included into my A.frameworkâ€™s binary, so the customerâ€™s app will only embed A.framework without any additional actions to link with that third-party app.</p>

<p>Usually below is the approach</p>
