I"}<p>I‚Äôm trying to prepare a single dynamic framework for third party. My framework (A.framework) uses third-party recognition static framework (B.framework). I can‚Äôt provide separate A and B frameworks to the customer. Ideally B.framework should be built and included into my A.framework‚Äôs binary, so the customer‚Äôs app will only embed A.framework without any additional actions to link with that third-party app.</p>

<p>Usually below is the approach</p>

<p><strong>1. Added B.framework to the project.</strong></p>

<p><strong>2. Added B.framework to ‚ÄúLinked Frameworks and Libraries‚Äù in the corresponding target.</strong></p>

<p><strong>3. Built A.framework.</strong></p>

<p><strong>4. Created a demo application and included A.framework to the project.</strong></p>

<p><strong>5. Added A.framework to ‚ÄúEmbedded Binaries‚Äù.</strong></p>

<p>But after run a application you will see the message</p>

<p>Even if the static library B is compiled with the framework A, a consuming client (an app or a framework) will still need to find the .swiftmodule or .modulemap file of the library B. The module information is used to expose the Swift API (or C,C++,objc) of module B when module A is imported!</p>

This is why moving files around or trying to copy the framework A to an other machine without bringing the interface of B will cause a compiler issue telling you Missing required module ‚ÄòB‚Äô. Simply tell the compiler where to find it the module information of B using HEADER_SEARCH_PATHS !</h2>
